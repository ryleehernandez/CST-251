RYLEE HERNANDEZ HOMEPAGE


		 Hello! My name is Rylee Hernandez, and I am from San Diego,CA! I have a shepard lab mix named, Klover, she is my bestie and we both love going to the beach!
			I just transferred out from my local community college to CSUMB, so it was a bummer that I couldn't move up to the area, but I am excited to see what there is to offer once I get to move!

		I am very excited to learn how to do code,be able to design my own sites, and put my own flare on things (once I actually get good enough!) Coding
		is something that I actually have no basic knowledge in, so I am so excited to put myself up to the challenges that it has to offer.

	With my new development knowledge I hope to be able create skills that I can hopefully use for the rest of my life, whether it be for my career or not!
	Technology and working with computers is something that is surely going to be around for decades and decades, so might as well get a head start on it!
