    <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
    <p> Create an organized HTML code, upload a picture, and make it change sizes
      each time the mouse hovers over it!</p>
    <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
    <p> The only problem that I had with this lab is when I uploaded the picture
      at first only a black screen was popping up. After further inspecting, only
      the top left of the photi was being shown because the width and height were
      too small.</p>
    <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
    <p> The lab ended up being a success and the photo changes and gets bigger
      when the mouse is hovering over it.</p>
