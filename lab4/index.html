	<h2>Subject of the Lab</h2>
		<p>
			The first focus of the lab was to locally test your files,
			 upload them to the server, and fix any errors that may
			 have popped up.</p>
		<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
			<p>
				A difficulty that Raeann and I encountered was trying to figure out a
				way to link the lab links without screenshotting and adding a picture
				to it. I shared with her the way I listed my labs in my website Homepage,
				and now it goes directly to her labs without needing a screenshot.
				Another problem I became attentive to was needing to list the "index.html"
				within my code, or it won't go directly to the website.</p>

		<h2>Result of Our Work</h2>
			<p>
				We were able to fix all of the problems that we orginally had with our
				links, and properly publish our webpages.</p>
