      <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
    <p> The purpose of this lab was to be able to float text either to left/right,
      and be able to center a different set of text. Also, add in two photos where one
      is centered horizontally, and one is centered horizontally and vertically.</p>
<br>
<br>
      <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
<p>One of the challenges that I had with this lab was that I wasn't exactly sure
how to horizontally and vertically center a photo, but after a visit to W3schools
my problem was resolved</p>
<br>
<br>
      <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
<p> I believe that we did everything in the lab correctly, and it all looks great, although
challenging the end result is always worth it.</p>
