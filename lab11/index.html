      <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
  <p>Experiment with block level styling while creating a sidebar, and creating links
  that stick at the top of the screen while scrolling farther down.</p>
      <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
      <p>The main challenge that I had with this lab was choosing "div#links", instead of the proper
  "nav#links". After figuring out what was wrong with the CSS, everything ran smoothly,
  and worked how it was supposed to.</p>
      <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
      <p>The links stick to the top of the page while scrolling, and the sidebar is also
  to the right side of the screen! Everything looks great!</p>
