<h2>Lab Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn how to properly insert images into
	 a browser, and link a website within that image.</p>
<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
<p> A difficulty that I encountered was having to link my website within the image,
	I had forgotten to put "https://" in the link which ultmiately messed it all up.
	Luckily my partner, Joshue, caught my error and helped me solve it.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p> We were successful in uploading our images, and linking them to our Instagrams!
