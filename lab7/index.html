  <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
<p> Use CSS styling code to create your own website browser while adding your own personal
  flare.</p>
  <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
<p> I had an issue with having my picture not allign into the inside of my box,
  but luckily my partner was able to go through my code and pinpoint exactly what
  was wrong. CSS is a lot more challenging to learn than HTML, but overall
it is a fun experience seeing everything come to life.</p>
  <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
<p> The style of our websites turned out so good, and it was so fun being able to
  go through and create our own color schemes!
