<h2>Which sketches work and inspire the team?</h2>
  The sketches that worked the best were the ones that mainly focused on baseball not
  just covid. Although Corona is taking over everyone's lives right now, my team knew that
  we wanted to focus on how the MLB was affected, and not just go off on a tagent about
  Covid.

<h2>Which ones are moving in a direction that the team wants to go?</h2>
<p> My team drew a lot of inspiration from Brooke and Nick's sketches because they moved
  the most fluidly throughout our topics and we were able to build the most off of each
  other through that. Through Brooke we came to the decision that we wanted to use drop
  down menus for clients to explore through the website with. Through Nick we were able to
  decide that we wanted to include pictures and designs throughout the site. </p>

<h2>What could be improved? What could be further developed?</h2>
<p> The overall design of the site could be improved overall. Of course this will
  come with as we continue to work on it, and bounce ideas off each other. We will need to decide on
  what kind of style we want to go throughout the site, colors, and how we will incooperate each
  topic into each other, and of course who will do each part of the site. </p>
