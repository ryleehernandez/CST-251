      <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
<p> Organize CSS style sheet while adding in margins and borders around the text,
  and change the background color of the webpage. </p>
      <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
<p> The main challenge that I had with this lab was getting my border to fit all
  around my picture and text, but after clicking through inspector I was able to
  figure it out!</p>
      <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
<p>The webpage looks amazing! It's so fun to be able to add your own style to certain
aspects of the web design!</p>
