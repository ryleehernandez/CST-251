<h2> Lab Purpose</h2>
<p> Create and upload a form, use a CSS file to style the website, and upload a
	photo along side it.</p>


<h2> Difficulties of Lab </h2>
<p> One of the difficulties that I ran into was figuring out how to link the forum
	to Google in order to actually search the answers, but other than that the
	assignment was very straight forward.</p>

<h2>Result of Lab</h2>
<p> My partner and I were able to successfully upload our website to our browser,
	and create a forum that links to Google.
