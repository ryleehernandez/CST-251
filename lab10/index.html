      <h2> Lab Purpose </h2>
<p> Style your website with different fonts, font colors, and letter spacing in
the CSS index. </p>
      <h2> Challenges With Lab </h2>
<p> One of the main challenges that came up with the lab  was changing the style
  font in the headings and paragraph, mostly because for the first 10 minutes
  I did not look up any other type of font names. After I looked them up it became
  clear what I needed to change. </p>
      <h2> Results of Lab </h2>
<p> It was quite simple learning how to change fonts, font color, and font style after
  getting the kinks out the first 10 minutes. The webpage looks great, and the
  colors are so fun to play with!</p>
